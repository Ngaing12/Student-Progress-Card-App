# Student-Progress-Card-App
A Student Progress Card App is an app that will be useful to the students to view their marks in any particular subject theyâ€™ve enrolled in. Faculty just has to enter their marks and students will be able to view them immediately **hassle-free** and without visiting the university's website.
Students shall also be able to track their performance in a given subject in an interactive form like **line graph**.
The project uses **Web Hosting** for maintaining database so that any person with the application can access it using internet unlike making local database.
